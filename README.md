##### Fonts used in original: 

- Arial 
- Sans-serif
- Roboto Slab
- serif 
- Inter 
- Helvetica

##### Fonts:

- I chose Lobster for the main headings(h1 and h2) because it puts emphasis on them. The overall website is minimalistic and I think using a font that is italized  brings more attention to these headings. 
- I chose Oswald for the other headings(h3, h4) because I wanted to make it evident that these were sub-headings. I think the overall mood of the website is calm and minimialistic so this font really depicts these things. 
- I chose Lato for the rest of the website because again it keeps the minimialistic aesthic. It is legible and gives a clean look to the webpage. 

##### CSS:

I ended up not making additional changes to the css because I decided that the website met the CRAP principles. Everything in the website was legible and made the website easy to navigate and read. I only decided to change the line-height to 2 rather than 1.75 because I thought the lines needed a little more spacing to make it much easier to read.
